# Python

first line in python file to make it executable

#!/usr/bin/python3
#! = Shebang

remember to chmod +x file.name to make executable

kali - visual editor is gedit and interpretor is just write python3 -> write code directly to terminal
ctrl + l in interpretor for clean slate

## Syntax

Indentation marks blocks of code
Comments with # or """ for multi line comment
importing with import
shorthand notaion -> multiple variables on on single line
input("") > makes the program stop and wait for terminal input

## Conventions

![conventions python](image-5.png)

immutable = can not be changed in anyway
you can reference the immutable var but you cant change it

make math operations by the real way maths works - priorities etc

## Types

### String str

operators: in, + , \*

immutable

![escape sequences](image-6.png)

built in funcs: len, max, min, slice, split, upper, lower, title, find, startswith, endswith, replace, strip, encode

#### split

x = "emma-kiosk"
y = x.split("-")
y prints ["emma", "kiosk"], which is a list

split without identifier, will split on white space

to set together again:
y = ":".join(y)
y prints "emma:kiosk" a string

#### print

will make assumption tat you want a space between concateneated strings and also add a new line in the end
overwrite that by adding argument in the end

- print(x, y, sep=""), can also print(x, y, sep="-") etc
- print(x,y,end="") will skip the new line, can also print(x,y,end=" /over") or whater
- combined : print(x, y, end=" ", sep=" :: ")

#### find

x.find("a") returns index of first occurence
x.rfind dos the same but starts from the end (rear)
if occurenec doesnt exists - get a -1

#### index

x.index("q")
if doesnt exists return an error
x.rindex("q") liek before, from the rear

#### strip

strip() both rear and leading
rstrip() rear
lstrip() leading

#### raw string

x = r"C:\test\newfile.txt"
becaue then it doesnt react to the \n and \t

### Numbers

Float, int

5 / 2 gives a float
5 // 2 gives integer (doesnt round up -just trashs the decimals)
5 % 2 gives you the remainder
2 \*\* 3 powers up (go go power rangers)

### None None

empty value

### Boolean bool

for i in list(range(1, 11)) :
if i % 2 : print(f'{i} is uneven)

x = False
not x
y = True \* 2 # Booleans behave like the numbers 1 (True) and 0 (False)
Logical operators: [not] [or] [and]

### List

ikke immutable
ordered
can contain other types : strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, functions, file objects and any type of number

x[0] # indexing from the front of the list
x[-1] # indexing from the back of the list
x[1:-1] # slicing from x[1] to x[-1], this last one not included
x[:3] # slicing from the beginning to x[3] excluded
x[-2:] # slicing from x[-2] to the end
x[::-1] revert list
x[::2] even elements in list

x = list(range(0,501,2)) - from 1 to 500 and only get even numbers

x[1:2:3]
1 is start index
2 is end index
3 is stepper

functions built in: len, max, min

methods built in : append, count, extend, insert, pop, remove, reverse, sort

sort doesnt change list, sorted changes list

#### operators:

in, +, \*

![list operations](image-7.png)

### Tuple

like list but immutable

built in functions : len, max, min

methods: count, index

operators: in, +, \*

indexes and slice work the same as in lists - but cant add, replace or remove elements (immutable)

### Dictionary

x = {"first": "one", 2: "two"}
x["first"] = "one" => Keys must be of an immutable type (string, number, tuple)

Values can be any kind of object (also lists and dictionaries)

built in functions: len, del

methods: clear, copy, get, items, keys, update, values

instead of old deprecated "has_keys" we use "in" operator

![dict operations](image-8.png)

### Set

unordered collections of objects without duplicates
Items in set must be immutable.

int, float, string, tuple (not list, dicts, sets)

## Control flow and structures

### If, elif, else
