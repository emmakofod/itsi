## 5 LAYER MODEL (BY HEART)

(exam question ex draw the model and the deep dive into one protocol)

### Top down approach

#### LAYER 5: Application layer

(protocols: HTTPS=443, DNS=53, SMTP=25, FTP=20/21, HTTP=80, SSH=22, NTP=123, DHCP=67/68) -BY HEART

#### LAYER 4: Transport layer

(protocols: TCP: in order,connection oriented (3 way handshake), congestion control, reliable (=no loss), flow control, sequecing; UDP: reverse TCP but FASTER, + EFFICIENT,LIGHTER)

#### LAYER 3: Network layer

(protocols: IPv4, IPv6, ICMP (for pinging fx.))[OSPF, RIP, BGP, ISPS]

#### Layer 2: DataLink (D-Link) Layer

(WiFi 802.11.x, EtherNet 802.3.x, ARP, bluetooth)

#### LAYER 1: Physical Layer

[cables, fiber etc out of scope]

### BY HEART

LAYER 5 -> message = Headers in payload (in Layer 5)
LAYER 4 -> segment => message + protocol from layer above etc
LAYER 3 -> Datagram (router)
LAYER 2 -> Frame (switch)
LAYER 1 -> Bits and Bytes

DNS, DHCP runs over UDP
IPv4, IPv6
ICMP
Wifi
Ethernet
are unreliable

HTTP, DNS, DHCP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, Ethernet, ARP ==> THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES!

## PROTOCOLS:

Def: Set of rules/standards/states for how 2 differents packets can intercat with each other. How do we communicate with each other? We have a lot of different ones, for different needs : security, performance, basic stuff, specifics needs and levels of communication. (ex, 5 layer levels).
